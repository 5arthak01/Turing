# Instructions to add a post
1. The basic structure has been setup with [Jekyll](www.jekyllrb.com). If you have not read anything about Jekyll, just go through these:
	* Go through *at least* one of these sources to be more comfortable with the process:
		1. [A YT video on adding post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsYqPL9EFwQ&ab_channel=MikeDane)
		2. [A Jekyll doc on adding post](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/08-blogging/)
	* Markdown tips and tricks
	Your Jekyll posts are not be html, they are markdown instead, which is more powerful and easier to use.
	**Do** visit this [cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) or a bit [detailed post](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
2. If this is your first post, add yourself as an author in [config file](https://github.com/deutranium/AI_AAD/blob/master/_config.yml)
3. Go through one of the posts already present, such as [Divide and Conquer](/_posts/2020-10-23-divide-and-conquer.md)
4. That's it! Now you can make your very own post and add it to [posts directory](/_posts) 
5. **Guidelines:**
* **DO NOT WORK ON THE MASTER**. Fork and then work on a new branch and then merge it with this master later.
* **TEST YOUR CODE BEFORE MERGING WITH MASTER**
* Do **not** use copyrighted images
* Add tags *and* categories as required
