### What is Turing?

**Turing** is an E-magazine initiative focused on Computer Science articles, ranging from fields like Quantum Computation and Cryptography to simple topics like Divide and Conquer Algorithms. The articles have been clubbed into different categories along with tags which makes them easier to find along with giving a glimpse to similar articles at the same time.

### How is Turing?
<sup>Thanks for asking :") We're good :) <span style="color: #fefefe">(or are we?)</span></sup>

**Turing** has been made possible with the Jekyll theme *[Mediumish](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/mediumish)* and a team of 12 including [Professor Kannan](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/srinathan/), [TA Mohit Sharma]() and 10 like-minded CS sophomores, who have started this website as the project for the Algorithm Analysis and Design course of the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad.

### Future plans?
The magazine has been in works ever since we started with new features being added here and there. The following points are some things that we are planning to expand upon.

- **Interviews:** We are planning to conduct interviews of professors from IIIT and pretty soon even people with experience from outside of IIIT to gain an insight into their work.

- **Adding category drawer below posts:** Say for a post of category *A*, there will be a drawer at the end of the page with thumbnails to other posts from the same category *A*.

- **Moving away from Disqus:** Comments functionality has been made possible using Disqus for now, but it also shows some ads on the page for the same. We would liek to move towards no ads and a better layout changeable according to the theme.
