**Turing** is an E-magazine initiative focused on Computer Science articles, ranging from fields like Quantum Computation and Cryptography to simple topics like Divide and Conquer Algorithms. The articles have been clubbed into different categories along with tags which makes them easier to find along with giving a glipse to similar articles at the same time.

#### How is Turing?

<sup>Thanks for asking :") We're good :) <span style="color: #fefefe">(or are we?)</span></sup>

**Turing** has been made possible with the Jekyll theme *[Mediumish](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/mediumish)* and a team of 12 including [Professor Kannan](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/srinathan/), [TA Mohit Sharma]() and 10 like-minded CS sophomores, who have started this website as the project for Algorithm Analysis and Design course.

#### Future plans?
<hr>
The magazine has been in works ever since we started with new features being added here and there now and then. Following points would be something we are planning to expand upon.

- **Interviews:** We are planning to conduct interviews of professors form IIIT and pretty soon even people with experience from outside IIIT to gain an insight into their life and journeys.

- **Adding category drawer below posts:** Say for a post of category *A*, there should be a drawer at the end of the page with thumbnails of other posts from the same category *A*.

- **Moving away from Disqus:** Comments functionality has been made possible Disqus for now, but it also shows some ads on the page for the same. Moving away towards no ads and a better layout changeable according to the theme.
